# SpeechRecorderGUIpy
<p>
This project was done using python and PyQt5.
Just something that was made to record speech and store the recorded speeches in a WAV file in the same directory as the python code. This app takes a text file, and outputs the first line of the file onto the screen. The person then records their voice within 5 seconds. This continues until there are no more lines in the text file to be read.
